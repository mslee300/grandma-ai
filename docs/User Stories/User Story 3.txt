As a user that has set my goals and custom messages, I want to choose which platforms and time intervals I will receive the messages on. There are some apps that I prefer to get messages through such as text, email or even dm’s on certain apps. This is because I use these apps frequently and I will see messages from them. Having a wide range of apps available can also allow for cross platform notifying since I use certain apps on my desktop more frequently than on my phone. Being able to set specific time intervals will also be helpful as I don’t want to receive notifications during the middle of the night. Having this option will keep me on my feet during my downtime but not be overbearing during work/sleep.
