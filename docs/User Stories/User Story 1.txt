As a new user, I want to be able to register/log in using pre-existing third party accounts such as Google, Twitter, or Facebook. I like this login method because I feel safer using my Google account for everything, and making a new account means one more password to remember. Also, new accounts run the risk of sending even more spam emails to my inbox, and I don’t like having a flooded inbox. I want the log-in and registration pages to be straightforward, because I don’t care for the complexity of the authentication page nearly as much as I do getting access to my content, and the easier it is to navigate this page, the better. That being said, it can be easy to navigate while still avoiding being an eyesore.
