As a user that has set their goals and time intervals, I want to be able to receive these messages on the specific platforms I select. If the app is to work correctly, I will be able to see the custom messages I wrote to help me achieve certain goals at the correct time intervals I set and on the apps I have chosen. If I am not able to see these notifications, then that means there is a bug not allowing me to receive messages. In the push notification, I want to be able to see the goal I have set for myself and a reminder message if I set it. I will also be sure to turn my notifications on for the apps I requested to receive notifications from in order to ensure that I see my reminders and custom messages.
