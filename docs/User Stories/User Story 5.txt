As a user that has been receiving messages correctly and working to fulfill my goals, I want to have the ability to mark that the goal is complete (or not completed) and halt all messages. I would like the ability to end notifications for each goal once I have completed them. By doing so, I could continue to subscribe to the application through my desired platform without having to block the messages on my end. Moreover, if I do not want to reach for the goal, having an option to end notifications would be a measure to not continue bugging me beyond the desired timeframe. However, the program does list: “if you do not complete the goal, it is not on us, it is on me!” I would also prefer to have the ability to edit specific goals; for example, change a goal like going to the gym to train more leg-focused workouts at the gym.
